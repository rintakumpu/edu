# Allegories of Mind: Steps Towards a Cognitive Thematics #

*Marco Caracciolo m.caracciolo@rug.nl, Breaching the gap between cognitive sciences and literature studies.*
*The Experientality of Narrative &ndash; An enactivist approach.*

Seeing cognition where there is strictly none, building cognitive models for characters. &rarr; Narrative fiction affords an indirect form of **metacogniton**.

If reading literary text is form of metacognition, what can it bring to cognitive sciences themselves? Or vice versa? Call for a "two-way dialogue" with cognitive science &amp;
literary studies. Mapping of cognitive literary studies ("cognitive thematics")

##Interpretation and cognitive science: minding the gap##

*Literary interpretation* How does literary interpretation work? Conncets textual particulars with more ceneral concerns (aethetic, ethical, social). Figure/ground structure of
interpretation. (See for example the Gestalt-Pacman-triangle-thingy). Interpretation is *flexible*, can build on many different grounds. Cognitive science can provide grounds for
interpretation.

What makes an interpretation *a good* interpretation? **Criteria**:

* Interest criterion (between interpretation and audience, for example Freudian reading of Balzac could be more interesting even if it unscientific unlike reading based on
  cognitive science &rarr; Caracciollo: **The scientific status of the reading does not necessarily make it more interesting**. Troscianko 2014: "Literary interpretation is not an
  a priori mode of explanation.", studying phenomena that determine interpretation? Korthals Altes 2014: "[literary meaning-making] goes way beyond the automatic inferencing or
  attribution of semantic meaning to words" which is what is studied by psychology/cognitive sciences)
* Textual critetion (sheds light on the text itself)
* Rhetorical criterion (well-built &amp;c.)
      
**Thesis 1.** The scientific status of the reading does not necessarily make it more interesting. **Thesis 2.** A given reading of a literary work cannot contribute to a scientific project as is. What is cognitive literary study to do? a. It can "apply" to texts cognitive-scientific models (**analogical approach**). b. It can move beyound interpretation (**precessual and functional approaches**). c. It can use interpretation in a heuristic way (**thematic approach**)
      
**Analogical approach**

Literature can be used to illustrate or exemplify a more general point about the workings of the human mind. *Analogical* in a sense that it presupposese an affinity between
      actual and historical and literary minds. Can result in novel readings, but metacognitive potential is fairly limited, fiction as ancillary to a cognitive-scientific model.
      (eg. Herman's reading of Joyce, modernist fiction actually foregrounds the embedding of mind in an organism that interacts with its surrounding, contra the usual reading
      focused on the life of the mind.)
      
      **Processual approach**
      
      Revisiting reader-response theory in light of cognitive-scientific models and methods. Applying methods of empirical investigation. Hypotheses on acts of reading.
      
      **Functional approach**
      
      Seeks to shed light on how engaging with literary texts can pay a role in broader psychological processes. Dialogue with evolutionary psychology, cognitive value of engaging
      with characters ("theory of mind"), Zunshine, Vermeule. Or reading literary as a "cognitive workout", the potential benefits of literary reading (ethical and so on).
      Hakemulder, Oatley. Or David Herman's work on narrative as "a tool of thinking".
      
      Processual and functional approaches sidestep the challenges of thesis 1 and 2. Yet they are not unproblematic, close reding plays no role in these projects and also
      a radical departure from literary studies with a steep learning curve. Also constraints on experimental research.
      
      ##Cognitive Thematics##
      
      **Hypothesis**: Literary texts may function as a probe into longstanding issues on mind sciences, not as straigthforward advance but as a heuristic.
      
      *Theme* as a **tension space** between subject matter and meaning. Point to horizon of culturally relevant questions and issues that mediate between specitic interpretive "grounds" and textual "figures". Questions explored by literature are *metacognitive*: consciousness, selfhood, emotion &amp;c. Literature can ask as to engage imaginatively and experimentally with metacognitive themes, philosophical intuition about selfhood is "put into practice" in Beckett's novel (*The Unnameable*)
      
      Literary texts can function as extended "intuition pumps", in Dennett's (1991) phrase. "More art than science.", heuristic knowledge that can be further scientifically used.
      Heuristic aspect of literary interpretation arises from the dialogue between cognitive-scientific ground and metacognitive figures in literature.
      
      Historical gap between cognitive-scientific models and conceptions of the mind embedded in literary texts (eg. Freudian view, analysis). Model for process: Metacognitive
      questions (themes) &rarr; 1. Prompt &rarr; Reading inspired by cognitive-scientific models ("grounds") &rarr; 2. Prompt &rarr; Metacognitive questions &rarr; 3. Reveal the
      limitations of &rarr; Readings inspired by cognitive-scientific models.
      
      ##Conclusion##
      
      "Cognitive literary study" is in many ways an umbrella term for a heterogenous projects. Engagement with cognitive-scientific models and methods vs. interpretative aims.
      
      **Literature** as a. object of interpretation, mental processes reflected in / thematized by b. set of psychological processes c. activity impacting readers' psychology.
      (Analogical/thematic-processual-functional.)
      
      Evacuating interpretation from literary studies is undesirable. Processual and functional research forgoes literature as its primary object of study, more like a subset of
      psychology. The functional approach to the cognitive study of literature can offer important tools to make a case for the *value* of interpretation.
      
      *How can cognitive science benefit from literary interpretation?* "Cross-pollination between mind-sciences and literature."
      
      By exploring metacognitive questions in imaginative, hands-on ways, litetature can point to inadequacies in correct conceptualizations of the mind and call attention o the
      ongoingness of any scientific endeavor. In turn, combining literary interpretation and cognitive-scientific models alerts us to thte defeasiblity of our own interpretations
      which build on temporally contingent views of mental processes and necessarily reflect non-scientific criteria and biases.
